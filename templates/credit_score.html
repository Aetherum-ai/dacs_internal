        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Credit Score:</h2>
        <p class="divcontenttext">
            While the DACS is designed to emphasize an individual's digital asset holdings as the key indicator of 
            creditworthiness,  it  also  integrates  elements  of  traditional  credit  assessment.  Conventional  credit 
            scores are incorporated into the DACS framework to account for historical credit behavior, such as 
            payment history, credit utilization, and length of credit history. This hybrid approach ensures that the 
            DACS  provides  a  more  comprehensive  and  balanced  view  of  an  individual's  financial  profile  by 
            recognizing both emerging financial behaviors in the digital economy and established credit practices.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Assets Under Management:</h2>
        <p class="divcontenttext">
            A  significant  component  of  the  DACS  calculation  is  based  on  assets  under  management  (AUM), 
            which serves as a proxy for an individual's overall financial capacity. By factoring in AUM, the DACS 
            framework recognizes the enhanced financial stability and lower risk typically associated with higher 
            net-worth individuals. This approach ensures that clients with substantial asset holdings are 
            appropriately  differentiated  and  may  be  afforded  greater  credit  privileges,  reflecting  their  ability  to 
            meet financial obligations more reliably. 

            For a fair comparison of AUM since the total AUM of an indiviudal just starting out in their career versus
            a retired CEO would be very different, Aetherum has decided to use age as the main categorical classification
            for determining different AUM brackets and what is acceptable. We use data from the fed to determine average 
            total retirement account balances per age group and compare from there. Ideally, we grade the AUM score based on how
            many deviations away from the mean the individual is with the mean achieving a score of 80% * 25 = 20 points. However,
            for the lack of comprehensive distribution data, I decided to categorize the AUM score into 3 different performances:

        <h5 style="text-align: center;"> Assets Under Management = \[
            f(A) = 
            \begin{cases}
            0.5w & \text{if } A < S \\
            0.8w & \text{if } S \leq A < 1.2S \\
            w & \text{if } A \geq 1.2S
            \end{cases}
            \]
            

            \begin{aligned}
            A & = \text{total AUM} \\
            S & = \text{average savings for the age group} \\

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Liquidity-Adjusted Net Worth:</h2>
            <p class="divcontenttext">
              The Liquidity-Adjusted Net Worth component is included to capture the liquidity of an individual's assets. 
              This metric is also a crucial part of the DACS to help ensure that the individual can payoff the loan immediately
              in the event of a default or a steep plunge in the cryptocurrency market. The Liquidity-Adjusted net worth score is 
              simply calculated by using the weighted average sum of the asset value to the liquidity matrix:
                        \[
          \text{Liquidity-Adjusted Net Worth} = \sum (\text{Asset Value}) \cdot (\text{Liquidity Score})
          \]
